                            <p>
                                Nokome is the creator and the main driving force behind Stencila. Before he launched the company, he was a fisheries scientist
                                focusing on the development, evaluation and selection of fisheries management procedures. During his research work
                                Nokome experienced many struggles with software development, problems with lack of interoperability of the existing
                                tools and explored many ways of addressing them. One of the solutions that he came up were <em>stencils</em> which gradually
                                evolved towards Stencila suite.
                                Nokome is based in Aotearoa New Zealand.
