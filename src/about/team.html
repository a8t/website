            <p>
              Nokome is the founder of Stencila. He is originally a marine scientist with over twenty years experience in research for sustainable  
              management of marine resources.  Stencila is a project born out of Nokome’s own frustrations with traditional copy and paste workflows and the 
              inaccessibility of many existing tools for data-driven research. 
              He set out to create a platform for reproducible research that bridges the gap in collaboration between coders and non-coders.
              Nokome is based in Aotearoa New Zealand.
