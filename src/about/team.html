            <p>
              Nokome is the creator and the main driving force behind Stencila. Before he launched the company, he was  a fisheries scientist
              focusing on the development, evaluation and selection of fisheries management procedures. During his research work
              Nokome experienced many struggles with software development, problems with lack of interoperability of the existing
              tools and explored many ways of addressing them. One of the solutions that he came up were <em>stencils</em> which gradually
              evolved towards Stencila suite.
              Nokome is based in Aotearoa New Zealand.
